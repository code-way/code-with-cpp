// A graph traversal is a method to traverse all nodes in a Graph.
// It is also use to search a particular node in a dense Graph.
// There are two types of traversals:
// BFS (Bredth First Search)
// DFS (Depth First Search)

// Bredth First Search :-
// -> It traverses graph 'Bredth-first', Starting from source, then direct neighbours of source vertex, and then next layer and so on.
// -> Iterative approach, like level order traversal in tree.
// -> uses a Queue Data Structure to maintain FIFO ordering, another Data Structure (array/map) is used to maintain the list of vertices visited so far.


// Complexity
// Time  Complexity : O(V+E) (using adjacency list) 
// explanation : because every node is pushed once into the queue and it's popped out once from the queue and In the worst case we have to also traverse the edge.
// Space Complexity : O(V)

// Applications
// Finding the single source shotest path in un-weighted graph.
// Finding the connected components.
// can be used in Flood Fill algorithm in 'Bucket' Tool in Photoshop, Paints etc for the colouring regions with same colours.
